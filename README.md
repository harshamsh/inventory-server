# Inventory server side Express.js Repository

This repository contains the backend for all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) applications using Express.js and MongoDB. The purpose of this repository is to provide a solid and scalable foundation for building robust and efficient web applications.

## Key Features

- Implements a robust and scalable RESTful API with Express.js
- Connects to MongoDB to manage and persist data
- Supports CRUD operations for all necessary data transactions

## MongoDB Schema and Connection

The schema for MongoDB is defined in the `models` directory and the connection to the database is established in the `app.js` file. This allows for easy maintenance and scalability of the database as the application grows.

## Part of a Task by Neirfeno

This repository is a part of a task assigned by Neirfeno to showcase the ability to implement a RESTful API with Express.js and MongoDB. The goal of this task is to demonstrate the understanding of building a backend for a web application and the ability to connect to a database.
